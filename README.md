# Global Info Cloud Task - Android Application

This are some highlighting things about this app

 - Supports Paging for viewing all products
 - Verifies address proof on device
 - Follows the android's best practices 
 - Handles configuration changes(like screen rotation) in most screens
 - Has good product viewing experience which consists of sliding images and full screen images
 - Uses Glide Caching for images where repeated pings would conserve bandwidth
 
  ## Due to time constraint this features weren't shipped or had some work arounds
  
 - Using demo payment gateway like Razor Pay but it requires extensive document verification therefore work around done was creating a demo payment simulating activity which returns result
 -  Firebase Cloud Messaging Service, I didn't really had enough server credits left to host my Spring Boot Service therefore it didn't make its way.
 - Has limited product editing, images couldn't be edited after uploaded once but product information could be edited.
