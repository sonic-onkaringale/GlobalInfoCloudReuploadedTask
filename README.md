# Global Info Cloud Task - Android Application

These are some highlighting things about this app

 - Supports Paging for viewing all products
 - Verifies address proof on the device using On Device ML KIT
 - Follows the most Android's best practices 
 - Handles configuration changes(like screen rotation) in most screens
 - Has a good product viewing experience which consists of sliding images and full-screen images
 - Uses Glide Caching for images where repeated pings would conserve bandwidth
 - Uploads Compressed Images on Cloud Storage
 
  ## Due to time constraints these features weren't shipped or had some workaround
  
 - Using a demo payment gateway like Razor Pay requires extensive document verification therefore workaround here done was creating a demo payment simulation activity which returns the result.
 -  Firebase Cloud Messaging Service, I didn't really have enough server credits left to host my Spring Boot Firebase Admin Service therefore it didn't make its way.
 - Has limited product editing, images couldn't be edited after being uploaded once but product information could be edited.
